* A multiple regression and clustering analysis of drug overdose mortalities as compared to demographic variables
* Demographic varaibles include: percentage of people below poverty level, median household income, percentage with a bachelorâ€™s degree or higher, percentage with a disability under 65 years, and unemployment rate
* States included in the analysis: Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Utah, and New Mexico by census tracts
* Simple linear regressions and multiple regressions measured at the alpha of 0.01
* Three cluster groups identified: Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 define low risk areas for drug overdose mortalities while Cluster 3 indicates high risk areas for drug overdose moralities

Passionate about GIS, cartography, and data analytics.  
Examples were compiled during my studies at California State University, Long Beach.

# Project 1: The Opioid Epidemic in the American Southwest

* A multiple regression and clustering analysis of drug overdose mortalities as compared to demographic variables
* Demographic variables include: percentage of people below poverty level, median household income, percentage with a bachelorâ€™s degree or higher, percentage with a disability under 65 years, and unemployment rate
* States included in the analysis: Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Utah, and New Mexico by census tracts
* Simple linear regressions and multiple regressions measured at the alpha of 0.01
* Three cluster groups identified: Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 define low risk areas for drug overdose mortalities while Cluster 3 indicates high risk areas for drug overdose mortalities

# Project 2: Colorado Food Deserts Linked to Obesity

* Research questions: Which Colorado census tracts are most susceptible to being in a food desert?  How do these food desert locations compare to obesity rates?
* Data: US Census Bureau - census tract shapefile, American Community Survey - poverty 2016, ESRI - grocery store locations 2014, Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment - obesity rates 2019
* Methodology: find most at-risk areas (greater than 25% poverty), create one mile buffer around grocery stores, erase one mile buffer from at risk areas, food deserts are identfied, spatial join obesity data, compare greater than 30% obesity to potential food desert tracts
* Results: Food deserts found most commonly in suburban and rural areas, strong realtionship does exist between high obesity rates and food deserts

# Project 3: An Analysis of a Hippo's Escape Route Using Weighted Overlay / Weighted Sum Tools

<p align="center">

</p>

* Background: Bubbles the Hippo escaped from his zoo enclosure in Orange County, CA.  This project investigated the potential routes Bubbles took from his enclosue to where he was captured.  A cost path analysis was conducted using variables slope percent, vegetation, and distance from roads.
* Data: DEM to measure slope, vegetation - US Forest Service, roads -  CalTrans
* Methodology: Create cost layers (rank and classify the three variables), rank the three variables by percent influence using weighted overlay and weighted sum tools, create total cost grid, calculate three pathways, buffer each pathway, combine pathways using union tool
* Rankings: Vegetation was ranked as the most influential variable, followed by slope, and then roads
* Result: Three potential pathways identified

# Project 4: Network Analysis in San Francisco

</p>

* Research question: What is the fastest route between four stops in the greater San Francisco area? 
* Data / Methodology: Roads shapefile, the networking was done using the network analysis tool
* This example was included in my portfolio to demonstrate the role of GIS in trnasporation and planning routes

# Project 5: Comparing Watersheds - Laguna Beach, CA

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96799772/147785424-ff23e2f2-c70d-428b-bfc7-d3e3c2399544.png"/>
</p>

* The purpose of this map is to understand the differences in watersheds based on hand drawn, computer derived, and scale.
* Scale influences results, specifically looking at the 3m vs 10m sheds.  The 3m and 10m sheds have different scales and resolution sizes of pixels.  The 3m DEM has a smaller cell size and a smaller resolution and therefore refers to areas that are defined with more detail.  This influences results as the computer delineated watersheds rely on scale to create the output.  

# Project 6: Sri Lanka Poverty and Agriculture

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96799772/147786325-8d1d9dee-20b4-426e-9cfd-5788475ea524.png"/>
</p>

* Red areas - western districts such as Colombo, Gampaha, some parts of Kalutara, northwestern district such as Kurunegala, Sabraragamu districts such as Patnapura and Kegalle. 
These areas have a higher percentage of households in poverty when percentage of agricultural households is high. 
* Blue areas - north central districts such as Polonnarawu and Anuradhapura, northwestern districts such as Kurunelga and Puttalam, southern districts such as Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, Sabaragamu disticts such as Ratnapura, and Uva districts such as Monaragala.
These areas have lower poverty when percentage of agricultural households is low. 

# Project 7: Point Patterns in Fire Analysis - Density

</p>

* Overall, larger values in the search radius produce a more generalized density output, whereas smaller search values produce an output that shows more detail.

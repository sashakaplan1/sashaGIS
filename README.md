* A multiple regression and clustering analysis of drug overdose mortalities as compared to demographic variables
* Demographic varaibles include: percentage of people below poverty level, median household income, percentage with a bachelorâ€™s degree or higher, percentage with a disability under 65 years, and unemployment rate
* States included in the analysis: Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Utah, and New Mexico by census tracts
* Simple linear regressions and multiple regressions measured at the alpha of 0.01
* Three cluster groups identified: Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 define low risk areas for drug overdose mortalities while Cluster 3 indicates high risk areas for drug overdose moralities

* Research questions: Which Colorado census tracts are most susceptible to being in a food desert?  How do these food desert locations compare to obesity rates?
* Data: US Census Bureau - census tract shapefile, American Community Survey - poverty 2016, ESRI - grocery store locations 2014, Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment - obesity rates 2019
* Methodology: find most at-risk areas (greater than 25% poverty), create one mile buffer around grocery stores, erase one mile buffer from at risk areas, food deserts are identfied, spatial join obesity data, compare greater than 30% obesity to potential food desert tracts
* Results: Food deserts found most commonly in suburban and rural areas, strong realtionship does exist between high obesity rates and food deserts

# Project 3: Hot and Cold Spot Analysis of 911 calls in Portland, OR

* Point data of 911 calls,  hot and cold pots identfied in relation to the three emergency response stations

# Project 4: Network Analysis in San Francisco

</p>

* Using the network analysis tool, a transporation route was identfied 
* The transporation route included four stops in the greater San Francisco area
* The quickest route was found as a result

# Project 5: Bubbles the Hippo Escape Route

</p>

* Bubbles the Hippo escaped from his zoo enclosure in Orange County, CA
* This project investiagted the potential rotues bubbles took from his enclouse to where he was ultimately found
* Three potenital escape routes were identifed based on vegetation, roads, and slope of the region
* The weighted sum and weighted overalay tools were utlized with the variables weighted at different scales
* Vegetation was predicted as the most influential variable, followed by slope, and then roads
